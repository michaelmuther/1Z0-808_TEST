Objects of which of the following classes can be thrown using a throw statement?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 3 option(s)
Event      // FALSE
Object     // FALSE
Throwable    // TRUE
Exception       // TRUE
RuntimeException    // TRUE


You can only throw a java.lang.Throwable object (i.e. an instance of Throwable or any of its direct or indirect
subclasses) using a throws clause. Remember that java.lang.Exception and java.lang.Error are the only two directly
subclasses of Throwable. All other exception classes inherit directly or indirectly from one of these two.
