//This question is based on 2 concepts:
//
//1. i == ++j is not same as i == j++;
//In the case of i == ++j, j is first incremented and then compared with i. While in the case of i == j++;, j is first compared with i and then incremented.
//
//2. The | operator, when applied for boolean operands, ensures that both the sides are evaluated. This is opposed to || which does not evaluate the Right Hand Side if the result can be known by just evaluating the Left Hand Side.
//
//Now, let us see the values of i and j at each step:
//
//int i = 1;
//int j = i++; // j is assigned 1 and i is incremented to 2
//if( (i==++j) | (i++ == j) )
//increment j (so, j becomes 2) and compare with i, this means, it returns true.
//since we are using the | operator here, we need to evaluate the next condition:
//that is, compare i with 2 and increment i. This means i becomes 3.
//{
//        i+=j; //i = 3+2 = 5
//        }
//        System.out.println(i); //prints 5
