public class String2 {

/*
Which of these methods are not a part of the String class?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 1 option(s)
trim // PART OF CLASS
length // PART OF CLASS
concat // PART OF CLASS
hashCode // PART OF CLASS, NOT AWARE OF THIS
reverse // NOT PART OF CLASS; ONLY STRINGBUILDER HAS REVERSE.
The String class has no reverse( ) method but StringBuffer (and StringBuilder) do have this method.
