Which of these statements concerning the use of modifiers are true?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 1 option(s)
By default (i.e. no modifier) the member is only accessible to classes in the same package and subclasses of the class. //FALSE
No, the member will be accessible only within the package.

You cannot specify visibility of local variables. // TRUE
They are always only accessible within the block in which they are declared.

Local variable always have default accessibility. // FALSE
A local variable (aka automatic variable) means a variable declared in a method. They don't have any accessibility.
They are accessible only from the block they are declared in.
Remember, they are not initialized automatically. You have to initialize them explicitly.

Local variables can be declared as private. // FALSE

Local variables can only be declared as public. // FALSE

You cannot apply any modifier except final to a local variable. i.e. you cannot make them transient, volatile, static, public, and private.
But you can apply access modifiers (public private and protected) and final, transient, volatile, static to instance variables.
You cannot apply native and synchronized to any kind of variable.
