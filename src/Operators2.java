Which of the following are NOT valid operators in Java?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 4 option(s)
sizeof // NOT A VALID OPERATOR IN JAVA
It is a valid operator in C++ but not in java because size of everything is known at compile time and is not machine dependent.

<<< // NOT A VALID OPERATOR IN JAVA
For left shifts there is no difference between shifting signed and unsigned values so there is only one leftshift '<<' in java.

instanceof // THIS IS A VALID JAVA OPERATOR

mod // NOT A VALID OPERATOR IN JAVA
No such thing.

equals // NOT A VALID OPERATOR IN JAVA
boolean equals(Object o) is a method in java.lang.Object. It is not an operator.
