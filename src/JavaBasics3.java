Given that OurClass is a MyClass and OurClass has a YourClass object.
Which of the following options are correct?

(Assume that OurClass, MyClass, and YourClass are valid java classes.)
Answered Correctly

You had to select 2 option(s)
MyClass contains a reference to OurClass
OurClass contains a reference to MyClass
MyClass contains a reference to YourClass
OurClass contains a reference to YourClass
OurClass inherits from MyClass


Visualize the hierarchy like this:
OurClass is a MyClass => OurClass extends  (or inherits from) MyClass. Thus, option 5 is correct.
OurClass has a YourClass => OurClass refers to (or contains a reference to ) YourClass object. Thus, option 4 is correct.
