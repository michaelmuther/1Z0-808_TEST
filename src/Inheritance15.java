/*
Casting a base class to a subclass as in : b = (B) a; is also called as narrowing (as you are trying to narrow the base
class object to a more specific class object) and needs explicit cast.
Casting a sub class to a base class as in: A a = b; is also called as widening and does not need any casting.

For example, consider two classes: Automobile and Car, where Car extends Automobile
Now, Automobile a = new Car(); is valid because a car is definitely an Automobile. So it does not need an explicit cast.

But, Car c = a; is not valid because 'a' is an Automobile and it may be a Car, a Truck, or a MotorCycle, so the
programmer has to explicitly let the compiler know that at runtime 'a' will point to an object of class Car. Therefore, the programmer must use an explicit cast:
Car c = (Car) a;
