public class Inheritance4 {
}
/*
Consider the following variable declaration within the definition of an interface:
  int i = 10;
Which of the following declarations defined in a non-abstract class, is equivalent to the above?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 1 option(s)
public static int i = 10; // FALSE
public final int i = 10;  // FALSE
public static final int i = 10;  // TRUE
public int i = 10; // FALSE
final int i = 10;  // FALSE


Fields in an interface are implicitly public, static and final. Although you can put these words in the interface
definition but it is not a good practice to do so.
