Which of these statements concerning interfaces are true?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 2 option(s)

An interface may extend an interface. // TRUE
Unlike a class, an interface can extend from multiple interfaces.

An interface may extend a class and may implement an interface. // FALSE
An interface cannot implement another interface. It can extend another interface but not a class.

A class can implement an interface and extend a class. // TRUE

A class can extend an interface and can implement a class.  // FALSE

An interface can only be implemented and cannot be extended. // FALSE
It can be extended by another interface.


The keyword implements is used when a class inherits method prototypes from an interface. The keyword extends is used
when an interface inherits from another interface, or a class inherits from another class.
